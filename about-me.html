                <p>
                    I am a guy borned in Shan dong Province China, 1992. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    I like learn new knowladge, and if it is possible, I would like sovle some real problem.
                    I do not want just learn them without prectice, that is boring. I was alway ambitious to
                    start learn a new thing, but my patient is very limited, and I would give up if I found
                    I have acquired basic of the new thing, or it is too hard of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I alway try to be myself, do what I like and say what I really think. And I have paied a
                    lot for this personnallty. I argue with lots perpel and I would sad when I find their are
                    not my kind. Stay alone is a good way to avoid above felling and hurting people. I may regret
                    a lot for what I missed, but I will not regret what I choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a lot interestings, I think we all have lots of interesting. But human bing's life was so short,
                    I only have about 15000 days from now. I maybe need choose a point to foucs on. Even it is hard, I choose
                    biology with no peticulary reson. And I have live in this field from 2011. I did it not good, and so what,
                    The field is beautiful, and many hypotheses waiting to be examed.

                            <p>Flavonoids is a kind of polyphenolic substances and distribute in vegetables and fruits
                            broadly. Flavonoids has wide biological activities, such as Antioxidant activity, antibacterial,
                            anti-inflammatory and anticancer. Flavonoids have different anticancer activity due to different
                            structure, we compare the anti-proliferation activity of 20 kinds of flavonoids using CCK-8
                            method, and analyze structure-function by flavonoids&#39; anti-proliferation activity to find out the
                            important efficient structure.</p>

                            <p>Synonymous codons are not used in equal frequencies, and this phenomenon is termed codon
                            bias or codon usage bias. Codon bias has significant influences on biological processes and then
                            influences the fitness of organisms. According to the region of proteins whether can form a stable
                            three-dimensional structure, regions of proteins can be divided into intrinsically disordered
                            regions(IDRs) and structural domains(SDs). Both IDRs and SDs have important functions, and
                            most proteins have both SDs and IDRs.
                            We studied the difference of codon bias between IDRs and SDs of orthologous single-copy
                            genes from human, chimpanzee and mouse genomes, and analyzed properties of genes which
                            codon bias between IDRs and SDs is different. We got 6,114 gene families of orthologous single-
                            copy genes of human, chimpanzee and mouse, and predicted IDRs and SDs of coding
                            sequence(CDS) of these genes by using SPOT-Disorder. Using sequence random simulation
                            method, we can judge if the codon bias of IDRs and SDs is significantly different. Genes which
                            codon bias of IDRs portion is significantly great than codon bias of SDs portion were defined as
                            IDRs strong codon bias genes, and genes which codon bias of IDRs portion is significantly less
                            than codon bias of SDs portion were defined as IDRs weak codon bias genes. We also studied the
                            conservation of IDRs strong/weak codon bias genes across these species, that is, three genes of a
                            gene family are all IDRs strong codon bias genes or are all IDRs weak codon bias genes.</p>
